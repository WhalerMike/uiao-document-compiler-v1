## 5. Core Concepts

The Seven Core Concepts govern the UIAO architecture:

1. **Conversation as the atomic unit** — Every interaction binds identity, certificates, addressing, path, QoS, and telemetry.
2. **Identity as the root namespace** — Every IP, certificate, subnet, policy, and telemetry event is derived from identity.
3. **Deterministic addressing** — Addressing is identity-derived and policy-driven.
4. **Certificate-anchored overlay** — mTLS anchors tunnels, services, and trust relationships.
5. **Telemetry as control** — Telemetry is a real-time control input, not passive reporting.
6. **Embedded governance and automation** — Governance is executed through orchestrated workflows, not manual tickets.
7. **Public service first** — Citizen experience, accessibility, and privacy are top-level design constraints.

## 6. Architecture Model

### Slide 1 — Program Overview

Unified Identity-Addressing-Overlay Architecture (UIAO) is a coordinated modernization effort across:

- **Microsoft Entra ID** — Identity Control Plane
- **ICAM (NIST 800-63, OMB M-19-17)** — Governance Backbone
- **InfoBlox IPAM** — Addressing Control Plane
- **Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN** — Network Control Plane
- **Cloud Telemetry + Location Services** — Telemetry Control Plane
- **TIC 3.0 Cloud + Branch** — Security and Compliance Plane

**Strategic Goal:** Transform the agency into a cloud-optimized, identity-driven, telemetry-informed, Zero Trust-aligned, TIC 3.0-compliant federal enterprise.

### Slide 2 — Why Modernization Is Required

#### Current State Challenges

- TIC 2.0 hairpin bottlenecks
- AD-centric identity with limited governance
- Fragmented IPAM across cloud and on-prem
- Limited telemetry visibility
- No INR or E911 readiness
- Inconsistent Zero Trust enforcement

#### Mission Impact

- Poor M365 performance
- Increased cyber risk
- Compliance gaps (TIC 3.0, FedRAMP 20x, SCuBA)
- Operational inefficiencies
- Slower mission execution

### Slide 3 — Program Vision

**End State:** A fully modernized, identity-driven, cloud-optimized, telemetry-rich federal network.

**Guiding Principles:**

- Zero Trust by default
- Identity as the new perimeter
- Telemetry as the truth source
- Cloud-first routing
- Incremental modernization (no big-bang)
- FedRAMP-aligned controls
- Modular, extensible architecture

**Design Principle:** If it degrades the citizen interaction, it does not ship.

### Slide 4 — The Six Control Planes

#### Identity Control Plane

- Entra ID
- ICAM governance
- Conditional Access
- PIM
- Lifecycle automation

#### Network Control Plane

- Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN
- Cloud OnRamp for M365
- INR integration
- Identity-aware segmentation

#### Addressing Control Plane

- InfoBlox IPAM
- DNS/DHCP modernization
- Cloud IPAM reconciliation

#### Telemetry and Location Control Plane

- M365 Network Telemetry
- SD-WAN telemetry
- Endpoint telemetry (Defender/Intune)
- DNS telemetry
- CDM/CLAW reporting
- SIEM ingestion

#### Security and Compliance Plane

- TIC 3.0 Cloud + Branch
- Zero Trust
- FedRAMP alignment
- NIST 800-63
- ICAM governance

#### Management Plane

- ServiceNow (CMDB, change, drift detection)
- Intune (device trust, compliance, configuration)

### Slide 5 — Frozen State Analysis

| Domain | Current State | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | On-prem AD, siloed | No unified identity graph |
| Addressing | Static spreadsheets | No identity-to-address binding |
| Network Security | L3/L4 firewalls | No identity-aware segmentation |
| Endpoint | Mixed tooling | No unified posture signal |
| App Delivery | Local auth | No workload identity |
| Telemetry | Siloed logs | No conversation-level correlation |
| Governance | Email/tickets | No automated enforcement |
| Data Protection | Manual classification | No data-aware routing |

### Slide 6 — Program Outcomes

- Reduced latency and improved M365 performance
- Stronger identity governance and compliance
- Accurate addressing and location inference
- Real-time telemetry for routing and security
- TIC 3.0 compliance across cloud and branch
- A unified, future-proof modernization foundation

## 7. Runtime Model

### Conversation Flow

1. Identity initiates
2. Addressing binds
3. Certificates authenticate
4. Overlay establishes path
5. Telemetry validates
6. Policy evaluates continuously

### Determinism

Given identical identity, boundary, telemetry, and assurance inputs, the system produces identical decisions across clouds and agencies.

### Continuous Evaluation

Telemetry continuously informs routing, access, segmentation, and compliance posture.

- Class C (Moderate)
- Telemetry-based validation
- OSCAL machine-readability
- Automated evidence generation

### TIC 3.0

- Cloud Use Case
- Branch Use Case
- Identity-centric segmentation

### NIST 800-63

- Identity assurance
- Authentication modernization
- ICAM governance
