# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This index lists all UIAO Architectural Decision Records.
ADRs document significant architectural decisions -- the context that drove them, the decision made, and the consequences of that decision.

Per CR-003, accepted ADRs are immutable.

## ADR Status Definitions

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| PROPOSED | Under review, not yet accepted |
| ACCEPTED | Approved by Governance Board -- immutable Decision field |
| DEPRECATED | Superseded by a newer ADR but retained for audit trail |
| SUPERSEDED | Replaced by a specific ADR (see `superseded_by` field) |

## ADR Governance Rules

Per CR-003 (ADR Immutability), once an ADR is ACCEPTED:

- The Context, Decision, and Date fields are immutable
- Amendments require a new superseding ADR
- The superseding ADR must include `supersedes: ADR-NNN`
- The superseded ADR must be updated with `superseded_by: ADR-MMM`

All ADR changes require Governance Plane approval. See [ADR-000](adr-000-adr-process.md) for the full process.
