# UIAO Governance Systemic-Risk Early-Warning Engine

## Real-Time, Multi-Signal Detection of Emerging Governance Failures

The Systemic-Risk Early-Warning Engine (SREWE) continuously monitors the governance runtime for early indicators of systemic drift, SLA stress, schema divergence, and automation instability.

---

## 1. Purpose

To detect systemic governance failures before they escalate, enabling proactive intervention.

---

## 2. Inputs

### A. Drift Signals

- Drift velocity
- Drift severity index
- Drift clustering density
- Cross-appendix correlation

### B. SLA Signals

- SLA-at-risk count
- SLA-breached count
- SLA trend slope

### C. Automation Signals

- CI validator accuracy
- Webhook uptime
- Workflow success rate

### D. Schema Signals

- Schema divergence
- Deprecated field reappearance

### E. Reliability Signals

- Owner reliability trend
- Appendix reliability trend

---

## 3. Detection Pipeline

### Step 1 - Signal Aggregation

Pulls from DB, CI logs, webhook logs, workflow logs, dashboard API.

### Step 2 - Feature Normalization

X_n = (X - min(X)) / (max(X) - min(X))

### Step 3 - Early-Warning Score

EWS = 0.25*DV_n + 0.25*SLA_n + 0.20*DSI_n + 0.15*AS_n + 0.15*SDR_n

### Step 4 - Classification

- Low risk
- Moderate risk
- High risk
- Critical systemic risk

### Step 5 - Governance Trigger

- Owner notification
- Schema review
- Automation audit
- Systemic drift intervention

---

## 4. Outputs

- Early-warning score (0-100)
- Drift cluster classification
- SLA stress classification
- Automation drift classification
- Recommended governance action
