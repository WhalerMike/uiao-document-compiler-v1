# UIAO Systemic Drift Early-Warning Playbook

## Canonical Actions for Detecting and Responding to Emerging Systemic Drift

This playbook defines how governance stewards detect, validate, and respond to early signs of systemic drift.

---

## 1. Early-Warning Signals

### A. Drift Pattern Signals

- Same error signature across multiple documents
- Drift clusters forming within 7-14 days
- Cross-appendix drift correlation > 40%

### B. SLA Signals

- Multiple owners with sla-at-risk
- SLA breach rate increasing week-over-week

### C. Automation Signals

- CI validator false negatives
- Webhook event loss
- Workflow failures

### D. Schema Signals

- Schema divergence > 5%
- Deprecated fields reappearing

---

## 2. Early-Warning Detection Workflow

### Step 1 - Identify Pattern

- Review drift events
- Compare CI signatures
- Check appendix clustering

### Step 2 - Validate Signal

- Confirm via dashboard
- Confirm via DB queries
- Confirm via workflow logs

### Step 3 - Classify Risk Level

- Low: isolated pattern
- Medium: multi-document
- High: multi-appendix
- Critical: corpus-wide

### Step 4 - Trigger Governance Actions

#### Low

- Notify owners
- Monitor for 7 days

#### Medium

- Require owner remediation
- Update CI validator rules

#### High

- Governance steward intervention
- Schema review
- Workflow update

#### Critical

- Freeze merges
- Full systemic drift RCA
- Automation audit
- Executive notification

---

## 3. Prevention Measures

- Quarterly schema review
- CI validator tuning
- Owner training
- Dashboard anomaly detection

---

## 4. Success Criteria

- Drift cluster dissolves
- SLA pressure decreases
- Automation stability restored
- Reliability scores stabilize
