## 5. Code Block Formatting

- Background: light gray (#f5f5f5)
- Border: 1px solid #e0e0e0
- Border-radius: 4px
- Padding: 8px
- Line wrapping: enabled (no horizontal overflow)
- Syntax highlighting: enabled where supported by PDF renderer

---

## 6. Table Formatting

- Header row: dark background (#2d3748), white text
- Alternating row shading: white / very light gray (#f9f9f9)
- Border: 1px solid #e2e8f0 on all cells
- Column widths: auto-fit to content, respect page margins
- Tables that exceed page width MUST be rotated to landscape orientation or split across pages

---

## 7. Diagram Inclusion

- PlantUML diagrams are rendered to SVG/PNG during MkDocs build
- All 6 architecture diagrams MUST be included in the PDF
- Diagrams are placed inline at their reference point in the document
- Minimum diagram width: 120mm
- Maximum diagram width: 150mm (fits within page margins)
- Caption format: "Figure N: [Diagram Title]"
- Diagrams that exceed 150mm width are placed on their own landscape page

---

## 8. Appendix Numbering

Appendices use a letter-number scheme matching the canonical directory structure:

- Appendix A: Adapter Plane (A-01 through A-04)
- Appendix B: Truth Fabric (B-01 through B-04)
- Appendix C: Drift Fabric (C-01 through C-03)
- Appendix D: Evidence Fabric (D-01 through D-04)
- Appendix E: Governance Plane (E-01 through E-03)

Appendix numbering is separate from main body page numbering. Appendix pages use the format "A-1", "A-2", "B-1", etc. in the footer.

---

## 9. ADR Numbering

ADRs are included in the PDF as a dedicated chapter: "Architectural Decision Records (ADR-005 through ADR-027)".

Each ADR entry includes:
- ADR number and title (H2 heading)
- Status badge (PROPOSED / ACCEPTED / DEPRECATED / SUPERSEDED)
- Date
- Context, Decision, Consequences sections

---

## 10. Accessibility Requirements

- All headings must use proper heading tags (H1–H6) — no bold paragraphs masquerading as headings
- All images must include alt text
- All tables must include a header row with `scope="col"`
- Color MUST NOT be the sole indicator of meaning — all color-coded elements must also use text labels
- PDF must be tagged for screen reader accessibility (PDF/UA compliance where renderer supports it)

---

## 11. Build Command

```bash
mkdocs build
# PDF output: site/pdf/uiao-governance-canon.pdf
```

The MkDocs PDF plugin is configured in `mkdocs.yml` under `plugins:`. The output file name and path are set in the plugin configuration. The PDF is NOT committed to the repository — it is produced as a CI artifact on each tagged release.
