# UIAO Governance Canon

!!! tip "Start Here"
    This is the **authoritative entry point** for the UIAO governance corpus.
    New readers should start here, then navigate to the relevant appendix.
    See the [Corpus Status Dashboard](corpus-status-dashboard.md) for document maturity at a glance.

The UIAO Governance Canon is the authoritative body of rules, definitions, decisions, and specifications
that govern the Universal Integration Adapter Orchestration (UIAO) framework.

## What Is the Canon?

The Canon is not a single document -- it is a structured collection of governance artifacts that together
define how UIAO is designed, operated, and evolved.

The Canon includes:

- **Canonical Rules (CR-001 through CR-005):** The five immutable governance constraints that all UIAO artifacts must conform to.
- **Glossary:** Authoritative definitions for all UIAO terminology.
- **Migration Plan:** The structured plan for transitioning documentation from flat to hierarchical canonical structure.
- **PDF Layout Specification:** Requirements for the printable/archival PDF export of the Canon.
- **Architectural Decision Records (ADR-000 through ADR-027):** Immutable records of all significant architectural decisions.
- **Appendices A through E:** Detailed specifications for each major UIAO subsystem.

> **Text alternative:** Canon Overview anchors five appendices (Adapter Model, Truth Fabric, Drift Fabric,
> Evidence Fabric, Governance Plane). A Cross-Fabric Interaction Layer connects them. Below: ADR Registry,
> Corpus Status Dashboard, and Contributor Workflows. Each node links to its landing page.

## Canon Authority

The Canon is maintained by the Governance Plane, which consists of:

- The UIAO Governance Board (human authority)
- The Canon Master Document (DOCX) -- the authoritative source per CR-002
- This Canonical Rules file -- the machine-readable policy

All changes to Canon content require Governance Plane ratification.
See [Canonical Rules](canonical-rules.md) for the formal ratification process.

| [Migration Plan](migration-plan.md) | How the documentation structure was migrated and what remains |
| [PDF Layout Spec](pdf-layout-spec.md) | Requirements for the PDF export of this Canon |
| [Corpus Status Dashboard](corpus-status-dashboard.md) | Document maturity and governance health at a glance |

## Status Definitions

All Canon files carry a `status` field in their frontmatter:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| MISSING | Stub placeholder -- no content yet |
| DRAFT | Content inserted but not yet ratified |
| ACTIVE | Ratified by Governance Plane -- authoritative |
| DEPRECATED | Superseded by newer content -- kept for audit trail |

## Canon Pointer

The `uiao-core` repository contains a `docs/CANON_POINTER.md` file that links back to this Canon.
Machine consumers that need to locate governance documentation should start from the Canon Pointer.
