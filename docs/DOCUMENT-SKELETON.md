# UIAO Canonical Document Skeleton v1.0

> A deterministic, plane-aligned, canon-aligned structure for all UIAO documents.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Version** | 1.0 |
| **Date** | 2026-03-26 |
| **Status** | Active |
| **Governed by** | `docs/STYLE-GUIDE.md`, `data/style-guide.yml` |
| **Template** | `templates/canonical-skeleton.md.j2` |
| **Machine-readable** | `data/document-skeleton.yml` |

---

## Overview

This skeleton is intentionally rigid. It is the architectural equivalent of a federal form: predictable, complete, and enforceable.

Every UIAO document -- from Identity Plane specs to FedRAMP crosswalks to modernization appendices -- must follow this exact structure unless explicitly exempted via `data/style-guide.yml`.

The skeleton enforces:

- Structural determinism across all documents
- Plane-aligned interoperability
- Consistent compliance mapping
- Self-governing canon integrity
- Automated document generation readiness

---

## Section 1: Title Page

Every document begins with a metadata block.

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Title | Yes | Document title |
| Subtitle | No | Clarifying subtitle if needed |
| Version | Yes | Semantic version (e.g., 1.0) |
| Date | Yes | ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| Classification | Yes | CUI, FOUO, or Unclassified |
| Source Plane(s) | Yes | One or more of the Six Control Planes |
| Document Type | Yes | Canon Volume, Architecture Spec, Appendix, Crosswalk, Project Plan, Leadership Briefing |

---

## Section 2: Purpose

A concise statement describing:

- **Why** this document exists
- **What** architectural or governance function it serves
- **Which audience** it supports

### Template Language

> This document defines the [PLANE/COMPONENT] architecture and its role in the Unified Identity-Addressing-Overlay (UIAO) modernization framework. It serves [AUDIENCE] by providing [FUNCTION].

---

## Section 3: Scope

Define:

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| Included | What this document covers |
| Excluded | What is explicitly out of scope |
| Boundaries | Logical or organizational boundaries |
| Assumptions | Preconditions that must be true |
| Dependencies | Other documents this depends on |

This prevents overlap and drift between documents.

---

## Section 4: Control Plane Alignment

A mandatory section declaring how this document relates to the Six Control Planes.

| Plane | Role |
|---|---|
| Identity Control Plane | [Primary / Dependent / Referenced / Not Applicable] |
| Network Control Plane | [Primary / Dependent / Referenced / Not Applicable] |
| Addressing Control Plane | [Primary / Dependent / Referenced / Not Applicable] |
| Telemetry and Location Control Plane | [Primary / Dependent / Referenced / Not Applicable] |
| Security and Compliance Plane | [Primary / Dependent / Referenced / Not Applicable] |
| Management Plane (ServiceNow + Intune) | [Primary / Dependent / Referenced / Not Applicable] |

Rules:

- Every document must have at least one **Primary** plane
- **Dependent** means this document consumes data from that plane
- **Referenced** means the plane is mentioned but not central
- **Not Applicable** means no interaction

---

## Section 5: Core Concepts

This section references the Seven Core Concepts from `data/style-guide.yml`. Only concepts relevant to the document are expanded; all seven are listed.

| # | Concept | Relevant |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Conversation as the atomic unit | [Yes/No] |
| 2 | Identity as the root namespace | [Yes/No] |
| 3 | Deterministic addressing | [Yes/No] |
| 4 | Certificate-anchored overlay | [Yes/No] |
| 5 | Telemetry as control | [Yes/No] |
| 6 | Embedded governance and automation | [Yes/No] |
| 7 | Public service first | [Yes/No] |

Each relevant concept is described using the canonical definitions from `data/style-guide.yml` frozen_definitions section.

---

## Section 6: Architecture Model

The technical heart of the document. Include all applicable subsections.

### 6.1 Architectural Overview

Narrative description of the plane or component. Written in the UIAO voice: authoritative, declarative, technically precise.

### 6.2 Architecture Diagram References

| Diagram | File Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [Name] | `docs/images/[filename].png` | [Description] |
| [Name] | `assets/[filename].drawio` | [Description] |

### 6.3 Component Definitions

Each component follows this pattern:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name** | [Component name] |
| **Purpose** | [What it does] |
| **Inputs** | [What it consumes] |
| **Outputs** | [What it produces] |
| **Dependencies** | [What it requires] |
| **Evidence Sources** | [Logs, APIs, dashboards] |

### 6.4 Data Flows

Describe conversation-level flows, identity flows, telemetry flows, or addressing flows as applicable.

### 6.5 Integration Points

Cross-plane and cross-system integrations. Reference the Control Plane Alignment table from Section 4.

---

## Section 7: Runtime Model

Describes how the architecture behaves at runtime.

### 7.1 Conversation Flow

The canonical runtime sequence:

1. Identity initiates
2. Addressing binds
3. Certificates authenticate
4. Overlay routes
5. Telemetry informs
6. Policy evaluates continuously

### 7.2 Deterministic Decisioning

Same inputs produce same outputs across clouds and agencies. Document any decision points specific to this component.

### 7.3 Continuous Evaluation

How telemetry modifies decisions in real time. Reference `data/monitoring-sources.yml` for telemetry sources.

### 7.4 Assurance Signals

| Signal Type | Source | Evaluation |
|---|---|---|
| Identity assurance | Entra ID / CyberArk | [Description] |
| Device assurance | Intune / CrowdStrike | [Description] |
| Path assurance | Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN | [Description] |
| Location assurance | Infoblox DDI | [Description] |

### 8.2 NIST 800-53 Rev 5 Controls

| Control ID | Control Name | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
