| Version | 1.0 |
| Date | 2026-03 |
| Classification | CUI/FOUO |
| Source Plane(s) | Management, Identity, Security, Telemetry |
| Document Type | Architectural Specification (00_Core) |

## 2. Purpose

This document defines the Management Plane of the Unified Identity-Addressing-Overlay (UIAO) architecture. It establishes ServiceNow and Microsoft Intune as the authoritative governance systems responsible for drift detection, configuration integrity, device compliance, continuous authorization, and operational lifecycle management. It also maps their capabilities to NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 controls required for FedRAMP 20x (Class C) authorization.

---

## 3. Scope

### Included

- Canonical definition of the Management Plane
- ServiceNow and Intune roles, responsibilities, and evidence sources
- NIST 800-53 Rev 5 control mappings
- Integration bindings across UIAO control planes
- Governance and drift-remediation workflows

### Excluded

- Vendor-specific deployment instructions
- Detailed CMDB schema design
- Device configuration baselines (covered in Intune profiles)

---

## 4. Control Plane Alignment

The Management Plane governs and enforces configuration integrity across all six UIAO control planes:

| Plane | Management Role |
|---|---|
| Identity | Device trust, lifecycle synchronization |
| Network | Overlay drift detection, segmentation enforcement |
| Addressing | IPAM reconciliation, authoritative inventory |
| Telemetry | Continuous monitoring, evidence generation |
| Security & Compliance | Zero Trust enforcement, FedRAMP alignment |
| Management | CMDB, change control, compliance posture |

ServiceNow and Intune jointly form the authoritative Management Plane.

---

## 5. Core Concepts

The Management Plane operationalizes the Seven Core Concepts:

1. Conversation as the atomic unit → Incident, change, and configuration events tied to identity and device
2. Identity as the root namespace → Device trust and configuration bound to identity
3. Deterministic addressing → CMDB reconciliation with IPAM as source of truth
4. Certificate-anchored overlay → Certificate drift detection and renewal workflows
5. Telemetry as control → Compliance signals drive access decisions
6. Embedded governance & automation → Automated remediation replaces manual tickets
7. Public service first → Reduced downtime, faster remediation, higher reliability

---

## 6. Architecture Model

### 6.1 Overview

The Management Plane ensures that UIAO remains drift-resistant, continuously authorized, and operationally compliant. It integrates:

- **ServiceNow** → System of record for incidents, changes, CMDB, and governance
- **Microsoft Intune** → Device compliance, configuration baselines, and hardware/software inventory

Together, they provide:

- Authoritative asset inventory (CM-8)
- Baseline configuration enforcement (CM-2, CM-6)
- Drift detection and remediation (CM-3, CA-7)
- Device trust for Conditional Access (AC-19)
- Evidence for FedRAMP 20x telemetry validation

### 6.2 ServiceNow — GovCommunityCloud

## 7. Runtime Model

The Management Plane enforces continuous authorization across all UIAO conversations.

### 7.1 Continuous Evaluation

- Device posture
- Certificate validity
- Configuration baseline
- Identity assurance
- Overlay integrity

### 7.2 Drift Detection

Drift is detected when:

- A device falls out of compliance
- A configuration baseline changes
- An overlay tunnel deviates from the approved baseline
- IPAM records diverge from CMDB
- Certificates expire or mismatch

### 7.3 Automated Remediation

Triggered via:

- ServiceNow change workflows
- Intune compliance enforcement
- Conditional Access policies
- Certificate renewal pipelines
- IPAM reconciliation

---

## 8. Compliance Mapping

The Management Plane provides evidence for:

- CM-2, CM-3, CM-6, CM-7, CM-8
- IR-4, IR-5, IR-6, IR-8
- AC-19
- IA-3
- CA-7
- SC-28

It also generates KSIs:

- KSI-CMT (baseline drift)
- KSI-PIY (inventory)
- KSI-IAM (identity/device trust)
- KSI-MLA (telemetry)
