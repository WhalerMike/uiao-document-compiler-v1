## 1. Purpose of the Telemetry Evidence Map

**NEW (Proposed)**

The Telemetry Evidence Map defines:

- What telemetry sources exist
- What each source proves
- Which control planes each source supports
- Which compliance controls each source satisfies
- Which drift domains each source detects
- How evidence is validated
- How evidence feeds governance

The Telemetry Evidence Map ensures that:

| Guarantee | Description |
|---|---|
| Control Coverage | Every control has at least one evidence source |
| Drift Coverage | Every drift domain has at least one detection source |
| Evidence-Backed Governance | Every governance decision is evidence-backed |
| Freshness | Evidence is fresh, validated, and correlated |
| Continuity | Compliance is continuous, not point-in-time |

This map is the **single source of truth for runtime evidence** and the evidence backbone of both the Continuous Compliance Engine (D3) and the Runtime Drift Engine (D2).

---

## 2. Evidence Source Categories

**NEW (Proposed)**

UIAO recognizes six categories of telemetry evidence:

| Category | Control Plane | Runtime Sequence Position |
|---|---|---|
| Identity Telemetry | Identity (Entra ID) | 1st |
| Addressing Telemetry | Addressing (IPAM) | 2nd |
| Certificate Telemetry | Certificates (PKI) | 3rd |
| Overlay Telemetry | Network (Overlay) | 4th |
| System Telemetry | Telemetry | 5th |
| CMDB Telemetry | CMDB | 6th |

These map directly to the runtime sequence:

```
Identity -> Addressing -> Certificates -> Overlay -> Telemetry -> Policy
```

---

## 3. Evidence Sources (Canonical List)

---

## 4. Evidence-to-Control Mapping Model

**NEW (Proposed)**

Each evidence source maps to drift domains, compliance controls, governance decisions, and automation validators:

```yaml
evidence_map:
  source: <string>
  category: <identity|addressing|certificate|overlay|system|cmdb>
  supports_drift:
    - <identity|addressing|certificate|overlay|telemetry|cmdb>
  supports_controls:
    - <fedramp_control_id>
    - <nist_control_id>
    - <tic3_control_id>
  validators:
    - <validator_script>
  freshness_requirement: <seconds>
  correlation_group: <group_id>
```

### Example: Authentication Logs

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| source | Entra ID Sign-In Logs |
| category | identity |
| supports_drift | Identity Drift |
| supports_controls | AC-2, AC-7, IA-2, IA-2(1) |
| validators | `validate_identity_logs.py` |
| freshness_requirement | 300 seconds (5 minutes) |
| correlation_group | identity-auth |

---

## 5. Evidence Freshness Requirements

**NEW (Proposed)**

| Category | Freshness Requirement | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Identity Evidence | <= 5 minutes | Real-time access decisions require current data |
| Addressing Evidence | <= 10 minutes | Network changes propagate within minutes |
| Certificate Evidence | <= 1 hour | Certificate lifecycle operates on longer timescales |
| Overlay Evidence | <= 5 minutes | Overlay routing changes affect security posture immediately |
| System Telemetry | <= 1 minute | System health requires near-real-time visibility |
| CMDB Evidence | <= 24 hours | Asset inventory changes are less frequent |

These values are **NEW (Proposed)** and can be tuned based on operational experience.

---

## 6. Evidence Correlation Model

**NEW (Proposed)**

Evidence is correlated across domains to create a multi-layer evidence graph:

| Correlation Pair | Relationship | Validation Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Identity <-> Addressing | User-to-IP binding | Verify authenticated users map to authorized subnets |
| Addressing <-> Overlay | IP-to-tunnel binding | Verify addressing aligns with overlay topology |
| Overlay <-> Telemetry | Tunnel-to-log binding | Verify overlay activity is captured in telemetry |
| Telemetry <-> CMDB | Log-to-asset binding | Verify telemetry sources map to registered assets |
| CMDB <-> Canon | Asset-to-architecture binding | Verify CMDB reflects canonical architecture |
| Identity <-> Certificates | User-to-certificate binding | Verify certificate-based auth aligns with identity |

This creates a **closed evidence loop** where each layer validates the next.

## 9. Integration with Sequence D Artifacts

**NEW (Proposed)**

| Artifact | Integration Point |
|---|---|
| Task D1 - Operational Governance Charter | Evidence map feeds governance decisions; evidence-backed governance principle |
| Task D2 - Runtime Drift Model | Evidence sources are detection inputs for all six drift domains |
| Task D3 - Continuous Compliance Engine | CCE consumes evidence map for control-to-telemetry linkage |
| Task D5 - Automation Enforcement Matrix | Automation enforces evidence freshness and validation rules |
| Document 00 - Control Plane Architecture | Evidence categories align to control plane domains |
| Document 09 - Crosswalk Index | Evidence-to-control mappings feed crosswalk regeneration |

This completes the runtime evidence layer.
