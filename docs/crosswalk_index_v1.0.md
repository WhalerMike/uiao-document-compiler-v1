# UIAO Crosswalk Index

**Unified Cross-Reference Matrix — Version 1.0** (2026-03)

---

## 1. Purpose

Single authoritative cross-reference matrix linking all UIAO components

The Crosswalk Index serves as the single authoritative map connecting every UIAO control plane to its governing specifications, architecture diagrams, project plans, canon volumes, and modernization appendices. This document enables traceability across the entire modernization program and supports impact analysis when any component changes.

---

## 2. Core Capabilities

The crosswalk provides the following capabilities across the UIAO architecture:

| Capability | Description |
| :--- | :--- |

| **Traceability** | Enables traceability across all control planes and documentation artifacts |

| **Dependency mapping** | Enables dependency mapping across all control planes and documentation artifacts |

| **Impact analysis** | Enables impact analysis across all control planes and documentation artifacts |

| **Canonical navigation** | Enables canonical navigation across all control planes and documentation artifacts |

| **Future expansion** | Enables future expansion across all control planes and documentation artifacts |


---

## 3. Unified Architecture Overview

The following diagram illustrates how the four control planes interconnect within the UIAO architecture. Each plane listed in the crosswalk matrix below maps to a specific region of this diagram.

## 4. Plane Crosswalk Matrix

This matrix provides the authoritative mapping between each UIAO control plane and its associated documentation artifacts.

## 5. Plane-to-Diagram Mapping

Each control plane is visualized through one or more architecture diagrams. The following sections detail which diagrams are relevant to each plane, enabling reviewers and auditors to quickly locate the visual representation of any component.


### 5.1. Identity Plane

The **Identity** plane is governed by `IdentityControlPlane.md` and is visualized in the following diagrams:


- Identity Control Plane Architecture.png

- Monitoring Domains Map.png

### 5.2. Network Plane

The **Network** plane is governed by `NetworkControlPlane.md` and is visualized in the following diagrams:

## 6. Cross-Plane Dependencies

The UIAO architecture is designed as an integrated system where control planes depend on each other. The following dependency map ensures that changes to one plane are evaluated for downstream impact on connected planes.

<img src="assets/images/mermaid/diagram_2.png" alt="diagram_2" />


### identity ↔ network

Identity depends on network reachability; Network depends on identity for segmentation and policy


### network ↔ addressing

Addressing is a sub-domain of network; IPAM drives routing, segmentation, and telemetry


### telemetry ↔ identity ↔ network ↔ addressing ↔ endpoint ↔ security

Telemetry consumes signals from all planes; Telemetry informs modernization sequencing


### security ↔ identity ↔ network ↔ addressing ↔ telemetry ↔ endpoint

Security overlays every plane; Security is a cross-cutting concern


### endpoint ↔ identity ↔ network

Endpoints authenticate via identity; Endpoints connect via network



---

## 7. Canon Expansion Rules

The UIAO canon follows strict expansion rules to maintain consistency and traceability as the documentation library grows. These rules govern how new appendices, volumes, and specifications are added to the architecture.


1. Every new plane must include a control plane spec, diagram, project plan, canon volume coverage, and appendix mapping

2. Every new diagram must be added to 02_ArchitectureDiagrams (PNG) and 03_Diagrams (DRAWIO)

3. Every new appendix must map to a plane, modernization track, and canon volume


---

## 8. Directory Structure (v4.0)

### 8.1. Governing Principles

The UIAO directory structure is organized according to the following principles:


- Deterministic

- Plane-aligned

- Canon-aligned

- Future-proof

- Fully modular and infinitely expandable


### 8.2. Directory Reference

| Directory | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |

| `00_Core` | Authoritative architectural specifications and control plane definitions |

| `01_Canon` | Publication-ready doctrine and executive-level artifacts |

| `01_ProjectPlans` | Modernization workstreams and plane-specific project plans |

| `02_Appendices` | Canonical appendices (00_Canon_Volumes) and individual expansions |

| `03_Appendices` | Modernization-specific appendices (A-E) |

| `02_ArchitectureDiagrams` | Rendered architecture diagrams (PNG) and markdown placeholders |

| `03_Diagrams` | Editable drawio source files |

| `04_Indexes` | Directory indexes, crosswalks, and repository metadata |

| `04_Templates` | Reusable templates for future volumes and documents |

| `05_Assets` | Images, diagrams, and placeholders for publication |

| `05_Reference` | External reference documents |

| `06_Drafts` | Sandbox for early drafts and experimental content |

| `OldDocs` | Full provenance archive of pre-canonical files |

| `Fix` | Reserved for repair operations and temporary staging |


### 8.3. Placement Rules


1. No files in root; all files must live in a subdirectory

2. Plane specs always live in 00_Core

3. Canon volumes always live in 01_Canon

4. PNG diagrams go to 02_ArchitectureDiagrams; drawio to 03_Diagrams

5. Canon volumes go to 02_Appendices/00_Canon_Volumes; modernization appendices to 03_Appendices

6. All legacy files remain in OldDocs until explicitly retired

## 9. Appendix Library Structure

The following diagram illustrates how the appendix canon is organized, processed through the Jinja2 rendering engine, and published to the documentation site.
