## 1. Purpose

The UIAO Consent Envelope is the first machine-readable, purpose-bound, legally anchored consent model for inter-agency and federal-to-state canonical claim sharing. It operationalizes MOUs and legal authorities (including IRC § 6103, Privacy Act, and FISMA) into a computable, auditable envelope attached to every claim transmission.

## 2. Legal Authority Anchors

| Authority | Applicable Claim Domain | UIAO Enforcement |
|---|---|---|
| IRC § 6103 | Tax data (IRS → State) | `legal_authority` field; purpose-bound transmission only |
| Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. § 552a) | PII claims | Consent purpose and expiry enforced at adapter boundary |
| FISMA / FedRAMP | All federal cloud-transmitted claims | Adapter must hold active ATO |
| State Data Sharing Agreements | State-received federal claims | MOU reference required in envelope |

## 4. Purpose Code Definitions

| Code | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `ELIGIBILITY` | Determining benefit or program eligibility | SSA income verification for SNAP |
| `BENEFITS` | Active benefit administration | CMS claims processing |
| `ENFORCEMENT` | Law enforcement or compliance action | DHS immigration status verification |
| `AUDIT` | IG or compliance review | FedRAMP continuous monitoring |
| `RESEARCH` | Anonymized statistical research only | CDC disease surveillance |

---

## 5. Enforcement at the Adapter Boundary

- Every outbound claim transmission MUST carry a valid `consent_envelope`
- Adapters MUST validate `consent_expiry` before every transmission
- `prohibited_uses` violations MUST trigger a `P1-CRITICAL` drift event
- Cross-boundary transmissions (`cross_boundary_flag: true`) require Canon Steward countersignature

## 6. Compliance Mapping

| NIST Control | Consent Envelope Field |
|---|---|
| AC-4 (Information Flow) | `purpose_code`, `permitted_uses`, `prohibited_uses` |
| AC-22 (Publicly Accessible Content) | `consent_granted_by`, `data_minimization` |
| AR-4 (Privacy Monitoring) | `consent_expiry`, `cross_boundary_flag` |
| IP-1 (Consent) | Full envelope |
