## 2. Purpose

This document defines the unified architecture of the Unified Identity-Addressing-Overlay (UIAO) system. It integrates all six control planes into a single, coherent, identity-driven, telemetry-informed modernization framework. It serves as the architectural foundation for project plans, compliance mappings, modernization timelines, and executive briefings.

## 4. Control Plane Alignment

This document describes the unified behavior of all six UIAO control planes:

| Plane | Role in Unified Architecture |
|---|---|
| Identity | Root namespace and assurance engine |
| Network | Routing, segmentation, and overlay transport |
| Addressing | Deterministic IPAM and DNS/DHCP authority |
| Telemetry & Location | Real-time signals for routing, security, and compliance |
| Security & Compliance | Zero Trust enforcement and FedRAMP alignment |
| Management | Governance, drift detection, CMDB, device compliance |

The unified architecture is the composition of these planes operating deterministically.

---

## 5. Core Concepts

The unified architecture is governed by the Seven Core Concepts, which must appear identically across all UIAO documents:

1. Conversation as the atomic unit
2. Identity as the root namespace
3. Deterministic addressing
4. Certificate-anchored overlay
5. Telemetry as control
6. Embedded governance & automation
7. Public service first

These concepts define the architectural philosophy and runtime behavior of UIAO.

## 6. Architecture Model

### 6.1 Overview

The UIAO architecture replaces legacy perimeter-centric, device-centric, and location-centric models with a federated, identity-driven, telemetry-informed control plane system. Each plane is authoritative for its domain, but all planes operate as a single, deterministic system.

The architecture is designed to:

- Eliminate TIC 2.0 bottlenecks
- Replace static addressing with identity-derived addressing
- Replace siloed logs with conversation-level telemetry
- Replace manual governance with automated enforcement
- Replace perimeter trust with continuous Zero Trust evaluation

### 6.2 Architectural Principles

The unified architecture is governed by the following principles:

- Zero Trust by default
- Identity as the new perimeter
- Telemetry as the truth source
- Cloud-first routing
- Incremental modernization (no big-bang)
- FedRAMP-aligned controls
- Modular, extensible architecture

These principles are mandatory across all UIAO implementations.

### 6.3 Plane Interactions

#### Identity <-> Network

Identity provides segmentation attributes; network enforces identity-aware routing.

#### Network <-> Addressing

Addressing provides deterministic IPs; network uses them for segmentation and telemetry correlation.

#### Addressing <-> Telemetry

IPAM provides identity-derived IPs; telemetry uses them for location inference and conversation correlation.

#### Telemetry <-> Security

Telemetry provides real-time assurance; security enforces Zero Trust decisions.

#### Security <-> Management

Security defines policy; management enforces drift detection and remediation.

#### Management <-> Identity

Device compliance and lifecycle events feed identity assurance.

This creates a closed-loop, self-governing architecture.

### 6.4 Frozen State Analysis

The unified architecture addresses the following legacy constraints:

| Domain | Frozen State | Required State |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | On-prem AD, siloed | Unified identity graph |
| Addressing | Static spreadsheets | Deterministic identity-derived addressing |
| Network Security | L3/L4 firewalls | Identity-aware segmentation |
| Endpoint | Mixed tooling | Unified posture signal |
| App Delivery | Monolithic, local auth | Workload identity |
| Telemetry | Siloed logs | Conversation-level correlation |
| Governance | Email/ticket-based | Automated enforcement |
| Data Protection | Manual classification | Data-aware routing |

The unified architecture provides the required state.

## 7. Runtime Model

UIAO operates on conversations as the atomic unit of runtime behavior.

### 7.1 Conversation Flow

1. Identity initiates
2. Addressing binds
3. Certificates authenticate
4. Overlay establishes path
5. Telemetry validates
6. Policy evaluates continuously

### 7.2 Deterministic Behavior

Given identical identity, boundary, telemetry, and assurance inputs, the system must produce the same decision across:

- Clouds
- Agencies
- Implementations

### 7.3 Continuous Evaluation

Telemetry modifies routing, access, and segmentation decisions in real time.

### 7.4 Assurance Signals

- Identity assurance
- Device posture
- Path quality
- Location inference
- Certificate validity

These signals drive continuous policy evaluation.
