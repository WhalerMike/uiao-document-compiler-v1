# UIAO Unified Architecture

**Version 1.0**

---

## 1. Architectural Overview

The Unified Identity-Addressing-Overlay Architecture (UIAO) is a modernization initiative designed to unify identity, addressing, routing, telemetry, and governance into a coherent, Zero Trust-aligned federal architecture. It integrates Microsoft Entra ID as the identity control plane, ICAM as the governance backbone, InfoBlox as the authoritative IPAM, Cisco SD-WAN as the routing control plane, and cloud-native telemetry and location services as the truth source for operational decisions. Together, these components form a coordinated modernization effort that replaces fragmented legacy systems with a cloud-optimized, identity-driven, telemetry-informed enterprise.
The strategic goal is to transform the agency into a modern federal network where identity is the perimeter, telemetry is the truth, routing is cloud-first, and governance is automated. UIAO provides the architectural foundation needed to meet Zero Trust expectations, TIC 3.0 requirements, and FedRAMP-aligned controls while improving mission performance and citizen experience.


The Unified Identity-Addressing-Overlay (UIAO) architecture integrates four control planes into a single cohesive framework. Each plane governs a distinct operational domain while sharing telemetry, policy signals, and configuration data with the others through well-defined integration points.

## 3. The Control Planes


### 3.1. Identity Control Plane

The Identity Control Plane is anchored in Entra ID and reinforced by ICAM governance, Conditional Access, Privileged Identity Management, and lifecycle automation. Identity becomes the authoritative source for access, addressing, certificates, and policy.



### 3.2. Network Control Plane

The Network Control Plane uses Cisco SD-WAN to deliver cloud-first routing, performance-optimized paths for M365, and identity-aware segmentation. Integration with INR enables location-aware routing and emergency services readiness.



### 3.3. Addressing Control Plane

The Addressing Control Plane modernizes IPAM through InfoBlox, replacing spreadsheets with authoritative, identity-derived addressing. DNS and DHCP are unified across cloud and on-prem environments, enabling consistent policy enforcement and accurate telemetry correlation.



### 3.4. Telemetry & Location Control Plane

The Telemetry and Location Control Plane consolidates signals from M365, SD-WAN, endpoints, DNS, CDM/CLAW, and SIEM platforms. Telemetry becomes a real-time control input for routing, security, and compliance, enabling conversation-level visibility across the enterprise.



### 3.5. Security & Compliance Plane

The Security and Compliance Plane aligns the architecture with TIC 3.0, Zero Trust, FedRAMP 20x Phase 2, NIST 800-63, and ICAM governance. Security becomes embedded in the architecture rather than bolted on, with automated enforcement replacing manual review.

## 4. Multi-Plane Integration

The UIAO architecture achieves its power through deep integration between control planes. The telemetry plane provides closed-loop feedback to all other planes, enabling real-time policy adjustment and continuous compliance validation.

## 5. Core Stack Integration

The following diagram illustrates how the three pillars of the UIAO framework interconnect. Each node is derived from the program data layer.

## 8. Seven Core Concepts


### 8.1. Conversation as the Atomic Unit

Every interaction—identity, certificate, addressing, path, QoS, and telemetry—is treated as a single, correlated conversation rather than isolated events.



### 8.2. Identity as the Root Namespace

Identity becomes the root namespace for all resources, ensuring that every IP address, certificate, subnet, policy, and telemetry event is derived from or bound to identity.



### 8.3. Deterministic Addressing

Addressing becomes deterministic and policy-driven, replacing ad-hoc assignment with identity-derived logic that enables accurate correlation and automated governance.



### 8.4. Certificate-Anchored Overlay

Certificates and mutual TLS anchor tunnels, services, and trust relationships across the enterprise.



### 8.5. Telemetry as Control

Telemetry becomes an active control input for routing, security, and compliance decisions rather than a passive reporting mechanism.



### 8.6. Embedded Governance & Automation

Governance is executed through orchestrated workflows that enforce policy consistently and reduce operational burden.



### 8.7. Public Service First

Citizen experience, accessibility, and privacy remain top-level design constraints.

## 9. Jinja2 Normalization Pipeline

All UIAO configuration data flows through a normalization pipeline that ensures consistency between YAML data sources and Jinja2 templates.
