# Appendix E — Governance Plane Architecture Diagram

This page describes the Governance Plane architecture. The PlantUML source diagram is maintained at [`diagrams/uiao-governance-plane.puml`](https://github.com/WhalerMike/uiao-docs/blob/main/diagrams/uiao-governance-plane.puml).

## Diagram Description

The Governance Plane diagram shows the internal structure of the Governance Plane and its interfaces with the ARB, Mission Partner Corridors, and the three operational fabrics. Key elements:

- **Governance Board** — human authority for Canon ratification and ADR acceptance
- **Canon DOCX** — the authoritative source document
- **Canonical Rules Engine** — machine-readable policy enforcement
- **ARB Interface** — escalation channel for cross-organizational decisions
- **Mission Partner Corridor Manager** — manages inter-organizational integration governance
- **Cross-Fabric Consistency Verifier** — quarterly consistency checks across all three fabrics

See [Appendix E](../appendix/e-governance-plane/index.md) for the full Governance Plane specification.
