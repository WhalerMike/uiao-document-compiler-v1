# Unified Identity-Addressing-Overlay Architecture (UIAO)

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Canonical Repository
**Classification:** CUI/FOUO

---

## 1. Overview

The Unified Identity-Addressing-Overlay Architecture (UIAO) is a 12-document modernization canon that defines a complete, deterministic, identity-driven, telemetry-informed federal architecture.

It spans six control planes: **Identity**, **Network**, **Addressing**, **Telemetry**, **Security**, and **Management**.

UIAO provides the architectural, compliance, governance, and leadership framework required to modernize federal environments in alignment with Zero Trust, TIC 3.0, NIST 800-63, and FedRAMP 20x.

## 2. Repository Structure

The repository contains 12 canonical documents, organized into four phases:

```
/docs
   00_ControlPlaneArchitecture.md      Phase 1 — Foundational Architecture
   01_UnifiedArchitecture.md           Phase 1 — Foundational Architecture
   02_CanonSpecification.md            Phase 1 — Foundational Architecture

   03_FedRAMP20x_Crosswalk.md          Phase 2 — Compliance & Governance
   04_FedRAMP20x_Phase2_Summary.md     Phase 2 — Compliance & Governance
   05_ManagementStack.md               Phase 2 — Compliance & Governance

   06_ProgramVision.md                 Phase 3 — Program & Leadership
   07_LeadershipBriefing.md            Phase 3 — Program & Leadership
   08_ModernizationTimeline.md         Phase 3 — Program & Leadership

   09_CrosswalkIndex.md                Phase 4 — Index & Cross-Reference
   10_DirectoryStructure.md            Phase 4 — Index & Cross-Reference
   11_GlossaryAndDefinitions.md        Phase 4 — Index & Cross-Reference
```

This structure is deterministic and must not be altered.

## 3. Canon Summary

The UIAO canon is built on the **Seven Core Concepts**:

1. **Conversation as the atomic unit** — Every interaction binds identity, certificates, addressing, path, QoS, and telemetry.
2. **Identity as the root namespace** — Every IP, certificate, subnet, policy, and telemetry event is derived from identity.
3. **Deterministic addressing** — Addressing is identity-derived and policy-driven.
4. **Certificate-anchored overlay** — mTLS anchors tunnels, services, and trust relationships.
5. **Telemetry as control** — Telemetry is a real-time control input, not passive reporting.
6. **Embedded governance and automation** — Governance is executed through orchestrated workflows, not manual tickets.
7. **Public service first** — Citizen experience, accessibility, and privacy are top-level design constraints.

These concepts appear identically across all 12 documents.

## 4. Control Planes

UIAO defines six control planes:

| Plane | Role |
|---|---|
| **Identity** | Entra ID, ICAM governance, Conditional Access, PIM, lifecycle automation |
| **Network** | Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN, Cloud OnRamp, INR, identity-aware segmentation |
| **Addressing** | InfoBlox IPAM, DNS/DHCP modernization, deterministic addressing |
| **Telemetry and Location** | M365 telemetry, SD-WAN telemetry, endpoint telemetry, CDM/CLAW, SIEM |
| **Security and Compliance** | TIC 3.0 Cloud + Branch, Zero Trust, FedRAMP 20x, NIST 800-63 |
| **Management** | ServiceNow CMDB, Intune device compliance, drift detection |

Each plane has a dedicated architectural role and compliance responsibility.

## 5. How to Use This Repository

<!-- NEW (Proposed) -->

This repository is designed for:

- **Architects** building Zero Trust and TIC 3.0-aligned environments
- **PMOs** managing modernization programs
- **CISOs and CIOs** requiring compliance alignment
- **Engineering teams** implementing identity, network, and addressing modernization
- **Governance teams** building drift-resistant operations

**Usage pattern:**

1. Start with **00-02** to understand the architecture
2. Use **03-05** for compliance and governance
3. Use **06-08** for leadership and program execution
4. Use **09-11** for navigation and metadata

## 6. Contribution Guidelines

<!-- NEW (Proposed) -->

- Canon documents (00-11) must never be modified without a formal revision
- All changes require review by a designated Canon Steward
- No renumbering, renaming, or relocation of canonical documents
- Appendices may be added but must follow naming rules defined in `10_DirectoryStructure.md`
- All contributions must comply with the Style Guide (`docs/STYLE-GUIDE.md`) and Canonical Skeleton (`docs/DOCUMENT-SKELETON.md`)

## 7. Versioning

<!-- NEW (Proposed) -->

The canon uses semantic versioning:

- **Major** — Canon revisions (structural or doctrinal changes)
- **Minor** — Additions to appendices or supporting artifacts
- **Patch** — Corrections or clarifications
